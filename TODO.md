* Solution for songs like Istanbul that start too quiet?
    * Have code to download simple waveform data from SoundCloud, just need to analyze it to find songs like this
    * Maybe just extend the first guess's timespan by a bit?
    * Maybe skip the first X ms of the track?
* Remove artist? Everything is TMBG
    * Or, remove artist from suggestion logic?
    * Makes picking songs like "They Might Be Giants" a pain
* Tab completion? Pick top suggestion?
    * If there is only 1 suggestion, use it on submit?
    * Use the enter key to submit, especially if there is only one suggestion?
* Share directly to apps? Meh.
* Allow playing past games, with id in the url?
    * If so, add the id to the shared url
    * Also need a banner with a "click to play today's game!"
    * Would need to ensure that this mode doesn't affect stats, unless it happens to be today.
* Separate "process songs" from "generate answers"?
