Nearly ran out of answers! They would have started to loop, but that's not ideal.

* Rewrote the code that extracts songs from Soundcloud and generates answers. It's still janky, but less janky.
* Added a few more year's worth of answers
* Switched tracks from "My Murdered Remains" versions to "I Like Fun" versions, where available.
* Added Tracks
  * "25 O'Clock" from "A Testimonial Dinner"
  * "Lazy" from "Lazy"
  * "Dr. Evil" from "Long Tall Weekend"
  * "Doctor Worm" from "Severe Tire Damage"
  * "Severe Tire Damage Theme" from "Severe Tire Damage"
